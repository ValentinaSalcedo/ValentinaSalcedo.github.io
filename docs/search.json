Before, I worked in different backgrounds. Thanks to the multifacetic jobs that I had, I was able to expand my vision.\n\n\nI just came back from Munich (Germany) where I completed my internship at Allianz, one of the world’s leading insurance and financial services providers. I worked for 6 months at Allianz SE, holding company of Allianz Group, in the H2 department, related to the finance processes. Specifically, I worked in the Group Actuarial Non-Life team, responsible for the Actuarial Function of the company, which is the team in charge of risk assessment, financial modeling, regulatory compliance, and strategic planning.\nIn my case, I was dedicated to:\n\nContributing to the team’s reporting products. Mainly Inflation Reserve and Group Reserve Committee;\nTesting new Reserve Reviewing approaches in ResQ, in particular, Bootstrapping for DFMs and Stochastic Result Selection to deal with confidence intervals for the ultimate claims;\nWorking on an internal project aiming to build and disclose a new model, developed in R, in order to properly assess implicit inflation in Run-Off triangles; in collaboration with one of the companies of the Group;\nSupport in building tools to facilitate and develop day-to-day processes;\nAutomatizing core reporting processes, by bridging data flow from SAP, Excel, and Word Implementation in VBA.\n\n\n\n\nFrom August 2023 to December 2024, I was involved in national medical research where I was in charge of the statistical part. The topic was “Education in lower and upper secondary schools and support of the network of reference figures for youth for prevention of HPV and other sexually transmitted infections”.\nMy tasks were:\n\nAnalyzing surveys via R and building reports for the different geographic areas and school levels;\nBuilding reports which contained stratified frequency tables, charts, models and statistical tests;\nWriting the methodologic analysis in research papers.\n\nThe models built were GLM (generalized linear models), some of them were zero-inflated quasipoisson due to the scoring rules of the survey. The statistical tests used were:\n\nMcNemar test for detecting if there is a change between the pre and post intervention.\nKruskal-Wallis test to identify if one socio-demographic characteristic is stochasticity superior to another one. This is also confirmed by the terms of the models built.\nChi-square and proportion test to inference when the frequency of an answer is different by socio-demographic characteristics.\n\nThe project is still on the way and once it finish, I’ll upload here all my notebooks and link my papers.\n\n\n\nIt sounds rare but during my bachelor’s, I worked for almost 3 years as a teacher in a public primary school. I started during the pandemic when there was a huge lack of teachers and I took the opportunity!\nIt was a big challenge for me. I was in charge of teaching subjects such as math and science to children from 6 to 11 y.o. It taught me to manage a team of about 25 people (the students), very heterogeneous. Actually, I didn’t learn only how to manage students, but also the other class teachers, as I was given the role of coordinator, handling all the bureaucratic stuff.\nIt was a really important part of my life where I learned (not only taught) a lot of soft skills about explaining hard concepts in an easy way (for the children is hard, trust me) and managing teams up to 25 people (and sometimes even parents ). In the meanwhile, I continued my studies so strategic planning of my life was the real key to success.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a short overall about my studies:\n\nMaster’s degree in Statistics and Actuarial Science with a curriculum in Data Science for Finance and Insurance at the University of Trieste. (Currently enrolled)\nErasmus, during my master, at the University of Malaga (Spain) where the classes were in Spanish.\nBachelor’s degree in Statistics and IT for Business, Finance, and Insurance, my thesis was focused on decisional tree models applied to the brewery industry.\n\nSo, my fields of study are mainly statistics, data science, actuarial science, IT, and finance."

    "text": "Personal Life\n\nSport\nI think that sport is very important in the life and helps to develop strength and health. Main sports:\n\nJudo: From 4 y.o., I have done international competitions around Europe. In 2016, I went for 3 weeks for a training camp in Japan. But about Judo, I’m proud of my siblings who have achieved world results, as my brother was 3rd in the World Judo Championship and 2nd in the European Judo Championship keeping the 1st place in the Juniors (U21) ranking -66Kg.\nRun: I’m not very fast and not the best runner definitely. But I’m really proud about a personal challenge done in 2023, where I finished a trail of 57 Km without ever having ran more than 21 Km. It was quite mind-challenging.\nMy secret dream is climbing, and that is my scope for the future. Until now I have only practiced bouldering in Germany, which is a fantastic place for that., but for sure one of my purposes for 2025 is finding my new place for bouldering.\n\n\n\nTravel\nI could be boring on this point but it is the truth. I think that post-COVID most people changed their habits and I wasn’t the exception. I’ve been to 20 countries, but some of them have been important for me:\n\nColombia: Follow my love and discover another one. That is the magic about travelling. I’ve lived for 3 months around this amazing country really different from what I expected.\nMalaga (Spain): I’m sure that everyone who has done an exchange program (e.g. Erasmus) can agree with me, I Ieft a piece of my heart.\nSweden: It took place in my first Erasmus project and helped me to fight my fear for English, besides that I got the chance of meeting people from around Europe full of energy and positivity.\nMarocco: I’ve been twice but why talking about the easy time with a touristic tour? Well, my girlfriend and I decided to take a random flight to the most unknown city, Nador, and what an adventure with no data and no local language during Ramadan. It has been a full immersion in the Arabic culture.\nHouston (USA): I went to a wedding and I had the opportunity to live as a Texan for one week.\n\n\n\nBeer\nI want to talk about the real beer: the craft one. I’m a nerd about craft beer, I brew my beer since 10 years ago and I use the BIAP method (Brew In A Pot). I love this hobby because it is a mix of creativity, science, and DIY. But I don’t only make it, I also taste it and as a good statistician, I record each one on Untapped!"

Additional Definitions\nAs used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\nAn “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\nThe “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n\n\n4. Combined Works\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n\n\n5. Combined Libraries\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library."
