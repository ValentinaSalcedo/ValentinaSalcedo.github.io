    "text": "Personal Life\n\nSport\nI think that sport is very important in the life and helps to develop strength and health. Main sports:\n\nRun: I’m invested in Strava. Lately, I had found that 20’s are the best years to try things out. My advice? Follow the run clubs, it makes it easier for you to respect a routine.\nDance: I know some people don’t think it’s a sport. But, I can assure you that five or six hours will make you sweat way more than the gym, if well done.\nCheerleading: Not like in the american movies. I know you taught about it, but just not. I spent my highschool years trying to memorize dance routines, with one or two jumps or acrobacy included. We made it to the regional every year and nationals once.\n\n\n\nFashion\nI have always been interested in this topic. When I was child I used to dream about the day I would be able to afford all the trendy clothes I wanted. Later, I re-discovered myself, and started trying unconventional styles, in order to find my own style. Still on that mission. On the journey, I found the second hand world and got fascinated by the impact it has.\n\nMalaga (Spain): I’m sure that everyone who has done an exchange program (e.g. Erasmus) can agree with me, I Ieft a piece of my heart.\nSweden: It took place in my first Erasmus project and helped me to fight my fear for English, besides that I got the chance of meeting people from around Europe full of energy and positivity.\nMarocco: I’ve been twice but why talking about the easy time with a touristic tour? Well, my girlfriend and I decided to take a random flight to the most unknown city, Nador, and what an adventure with no data and no local language during Ramadan. It has been a full immersion in the Arabic culture.\nHouston (USA): I went to a wedding and I had the opportunity to live as a Texan for one week.\n\n\n\nBeer\nI want to talk about the real beer: the craft one. I’m a nerd about craft beer, I brew my beer since 10 years ago and I use the BIAP method (Brew In A Pot). I love this hobby because it is a mix of creativity, science, and DIY. But I don’t only make it, I also taste it and as a good statistician, I record each one on Untapped!"

This study explores the awareness, knowledge, and vaccination practices of Italian adolescents regarding the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and its vaccine. As a contributor to the methodology and formal analysis sections, I helped reveal crucial insights into the existing gaps in knowledge and vaccination coverage.\nOur research, conducted across three regions in Italy, highlights significant misunderstandings among adolescents about HPV transmission and the diseases it causes. The study emphasizes the urgent need for better educational efforts and coordinated national strategies to enhance awareness and increase vaccination rates.\nFor those interested in public health and adolescent education, I invite you to read the full article here. Your thoughts and feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground/Objectives: HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infectious agent worldwide and adolescents are at high risk of contracting HPV. The aim of our study was to find out how much adolescents know about the virus and its effects, and to obtain information on attitudes and behaviors regarding HPV vaccination to close these gaps. Methods: As part of the ESPRIT project, 598 lower secondary (11–14 years) and upper secondary (14–19 years) school students from three Italian regions were surveyed between December 2023 and March 2024 using a seven-question online questionnaire on awareness, knowledge, and attitudes about HPV and the HPV vaccine. Count and zero-inflation models were used to determine correlations between sexes, urban/suburban, province of residence, and school type with knowledge. Results: Lower secondary students believed that HPV causes HIV/AIDS (8.9%) or hepatitis C (3.0%) and rarely mentioned anal (21%) and oral sex (9.6%) as ways of transmission. Among upper secondary students, misconceptions were similar, with worrying rates of students stating that HPV only causes cancer in females (18%) or males (2.4%), and low rates of identifying transmission risk through anal (41%) and oral (34%) sex and genital contact (38%). The HPV vaccination rate was quite low (47% in lower secondary students, 61% in upper secondary students). In the regressions, sex, urban/suburban area, and province were the variables associated with higher levels of knowledge for lower secondary students; for upper secondary students, level of knowledge was associated with sex, urban/suburban area, school type, and province of residence. Conclusions: Awareness and knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine are low among Italian students in this study and reported vaccination coverage is below the national target. Coordinated efforts at the national level are needed to address this public health issue."

    "text": "My contributions\n\nData Anlaysis\nSociodemographic data such as school characteristics (e.g., urban/suburban, lower/upper secondary school, northern/central/southern Italy, type of upper secondary school) and participant characteristics (e.g., gender) were included as predictors in the model, while the total score was set as the dependent variable. The types of upper secondary schools considered reflect the three main types of schools that exist in Italy: academic schools (in which the education is mainly theoretical, with a specialization in a specific field, e.g., humanities and antiquity, mathematics and natural sciences, foreign languages, psychology and pedagogy, social sciences, fine arts), technical schools (in which the education provides both a broad theoretical training and a specialization in a specific field (e.g., economics, administration, technology, tourism, agronomy), often in combination with a three-/six-month internship in a company, association, or college), and vocational schools (this type of school provides secondary education with a focus on practical subjects (e.g., engineering, agriculture, gastronomy, technical assistance, crafts) and allows students to start looking for a job immediately after completing their education). None of these types of schools are likely to be single-sex schools in the national public system.\nThere were several possible answers to each question. If an answer was marked correctly, the student received +1, otherwise 0. If the answer was “I don’t know”, the score for the entire question was set to 0, as the student did not know the correct answer, even if they had not marked the wrong answer. The answers given by the students as strings (i.e., “Other”) were not considered when calculating the points. The total score was calculated as the sum of the scores for each valuable question, including Q1, Q2, and Q4. For every question, the frequency and probability of responses for every socio-demographic characteristic were calculated. In addition, the p-value and significance of the proportion test were calculated for each pair of sociodemographic characteristics. The minimum p-value was set at 0.05 and the test power had to be at least 0.8. For the analysis of the overall scores, each observation was weighted to obtain an inverse propensity weighting (IPW) for each linear combination of sociodemographic characteristics. However, for some linear combinations, there were no observations, because there were no schools for these combinations, which made an IPW impossible. Therefore, the data for these groups were generated using a generalized linear model (family quasipoisson) to minimize bias, and then the IPW was calculated. For each socio-demographic characteristic, the weighted Kruskal–Wallis test was calculated to demonstrate stochastic superiority. A t-test or ANOVA test was not used as the assumptions were not met. Finally, a weighted Poisson model with zero-inflation was calculated. First, the probability of receiving 0 points in the survey was assessed using a binomial model and then a Poisson model was calculated."

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n\n\n5. Combined Libraries\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library."
