    "text": "Personal Life\n\nSport\nI think that sport is very important in the life and helps to develop strength and health. Main sports:\n\nRun: I’m invested in Strava. Lately, I had found that 20’s are the best years to try things out. My advice? Follow the run clubs, it makes it easier for you to respect a routine.\nDance: I know some people don’t think it’s a sport. But, I can assure you that five or six hours will make you sweat way more than the gym, if well done.\nCheerleading: Not like in the american movies. I know you taught about it, but just not. I spent my highschool years trying to memorize dance routines, with one or two jumps or acrobacy included. We made it to the regional every year and nationals once.\n\n\n\nFashion\nI have always been interested in this topic. When I was child I used to dream about the day I would be able to afford all the trendy clothes I wanted. Later, I re-discovered myself, and started trying unconventional styles, in order to find my own style. Still on that mission. On the journey, I found the second hand world and got fascinated by the impact it has.\n\nMalaga (Spain): I’m sure that everyone who has done an exchange program (e.g. Erasmus) can agree with me, I Ieft a piece of my heart.\nSweden: It took place in my first Erasmus project and helped me to fight my fear for English, besides that I got the chance of meeting people from around Europe full of energy and positivity.\nMarocco: I’ve been twice but why talking about the easy time with a touristic tour? Well, my girlfriend and I decided to take a random flight to the most unknown city, Nador, and what an adventure with no data and no local language during Ramadan. It has been a full immersion in the Arabic culture.\nHouston (USA): I went to a wedding and I had the opportunity to live as a Texan for one week.\n\n\n\nBeer\nI want to talk about the real beer: the craft one. I’m a nerd about craft beer, I brew my beer since 10 years ago and I use the BIAP method (Brew In A Pot). I love this hobby because it is a mix of creativity, science, and DIY. But I don’t only make it, I also taste it and as a good statistician, I record each one on Untapped!"

    "text": "Italy is renowned for its coffee shops on every corner. This devotion to coffee, however, is taken to a whole different level in Trieste. Trieste was one of the first European cities to open the botteghe da caffè. In the 1700s, these coffeehouses became popular as meeting places for politicians, artists, journalists, writers, and intellectuals. The city’s strategic location between what was once the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Slovenia meant that it was a key entry point for the high-quality green coffee beans coming from Asia, South America, and Africa. Trieste is also the birthplace of the renowned Illy company, a pioneer in espresso machine innovation.\nIn all this time, not much has changed in terms of coffee. Trieste’s inhabitants are very proud of the history and culture that have taken place in their cafés. Like many Italians, they love their coffee. And to make sure that everyone is aware just how important coffee is to them, they’ve made coffee drinking their thing.\nIf you want to order like a true Triestino, you will need a dictionary first. Here’s a quick guide, in case you don’t have one.\n\nNero: A standard espresso served in a small cup.\nCapo: A version of a cappuccino with just a touch of milk, similar to an espresso macchiato.\nGocciato: An espresso with a small drop of milk foam on top.\n\nThese are just a few of the dozens of combinations you can order. To really impress your Italian server, ask for the capo in b (same as capo but in a glass). They will be surprised to see that a tourist unaccompanied by a local seems to know about this classic coffee.\nBut where can you savor this experience?"

This study explores the awareness, knowledge, and vaccination practices of Italian adolescents regarding the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and its vaccine. As a contributor to the methodology and formal analysis sections, I helped reveal crucial insights into the existing gaps in knowledge and vaccination coverage.\nOur research, conducted across three regions in Italy, highlights significant misunderstandings among adolescents about HPV transmission and the diseases it causes. The study emphasizes the urgent need for better educational efforts and coordinated national strategies to enhance awareness and increase vaccination rates.\nFor those interested in public health and adolescent education, I invite you to read the full article here. Your thoughts and feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground/Objectives: HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infectious agent worldwide and adolescents are at high risk of contracting HPV. The aim of our study was to find out how much adolescents know about the virus and its effects, and to obtain information on attitudes and behaviors regarding HPV vaccination to close these gaps. Methods: As part of the ESPRIT project, 598 lower secondary (11–14 years) and upper secondary (14–19 years) school students from three Italian regions were surveyed between December 2023 and March 2024 using a seven-question online questionnaire on awareness, knowledge, and attitudes about HPV and the HPV vaccine. Count and zero-inflation models were used to determine correlations between sexes, urban/suburban, province of residence, and school type with knowledge. Results: Lower secondary students believed that HPV causes HIV/AIDS (8.9%) or hepatitis C (3.0%) and rarely mentioned anal (21%) and oral sex (9.6%) as ways of transmission. Among upper secondary students, misconceptions were similar, with worrying rates of students stating that HPV only causes cancer in females (18%) or males (2.4%), and low rates of identifying transmission risk through anal (41%) and oral (34%) sex and genital contact (38%). The HPV vaccination rate was quite low (47% in lower secondary students, 61% in upper secondary students). In the regressions, sex, urban/suburban area, and province were the variables associated with higher levels of knowledge for lower secondary students; for upper secondary students, level of knowledge was associated with sex, urban/suburban area, school type, and province of residence. Conclusions: Awareness and knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine are low among Italian students in this study and reported vaccination coverage is below the national target. Coordinated efforts at the national level are needed to address this public health issue."

    "text": "My contributions\n\nData Anlaysis\nSociodemographic data such as school characteristics (e.g., urban/suburban, lower/upper secondary school, northern/central/southern Italy, type of upper secondary school) and participant characteristics (e.g., gender) were included as predictors in the model, while the total score was set as the dependent variable. The types of upper secondary schools considered reflect the three main types of schools that exist in Italy: academic schools (in which the education is mainly theoretical, with a specialization in a specific field, e.g., humanities and antiquity, mathematics and natural sciences, foreign languages, psychology and pedagogy, social sciences, fine arts), technical schools (in which the education provides both a broad theoretical training and a specialization in a specific field (e.g., economics, administration, technology, tourism, agronomy), often in combination with a three-/six-month internship in a company, association, or college), and vocational schools (this type of school provides secondary education with a focus on practical subjects (e.g., engineering, agriculture, gastronomy, technical assistance, crafts) and allows students to start looking for a job immediately after completing their education). None of these types of schools are likely to be single-sex schools in the national public system.\nThere were several possible answers to each question. If an answer was marked correctly, the student received +1, otherwise 0. If the answer was “I don’t know”, the score for the entire question was set to 0, as the student did not know the correct answer, even if they had not marked the wrong answer. The answers given by the students as strings (i.e., “Other”) were not considered when calculating the points. The total score was calculated as the sum of the scores for each valuable question, including Q1, Q2, and Q4. For every question, the frequency and probability of responses for every socio-demographic characteristic were calculated. In addition, the p-value and significance of the proportion test were calculated for each pair of sociodemographic characteristics. The minimum p-value was set at 0.05 and the test power had to be at least 0.8. For the analysis of the overall scores, each observation was weighted to obtain an inverse propensity weighting (IPW) for each linear combination of sociodemographic characteristics. However, for some linear combinations, there were no observations, because there were no schools for these combinations, which made an IPW impossible. Therefore, the data for these groups were generated using a generalized linear model (family quasipoisson) to minimize bias, and then the IPW was calculated. For each socio-demographic characteristic, the weighted Kruskal–Wallis test was calculated to demonstrate stochastic superiority. A t-test or ANOVA test was not used as the assumptions were not met. Finally, a weighted Poisson model with zero-inflation was calculated. First, the probability of receiving 0 points in the survey was assessed using a binomial model and then a Poisson model was calculated."

    "text": "Is there a difference between eating because you have to and eating because you love food? I think there is, and that summer highlights this difference in a way no other season does.\nOf course, we all need filling, nutritious meals if we are to function — at least 1,600 calories a day. But when eating becomes an experience to savor, to remember, and to share, then chewing and swallowing becomes a joy.\nWhen I first moved to Italy, I was surprised by how much people talk about food. Italians don’t just eat. They love food. And they are very proud of their cuisine. It’s quite normal to hear a group of friends debating the cooking times of a recipe, or to arrive early to someone’s house to help in the kitchen, chatting while sampling appetizers as the main meal is being cooked.\nMeals are are culture. They are lessons. Italian children learn basic cooking by observing, listening, and sometimes helping their moms.\nFood is part of every plan, whether that is a day at the beach, a weekend trip, or a visit to a friend’s house. The questions, “What should we bring? What are they making?”, always come up.\nIt was summer when I arrived in Italy. I felt like I was being hugged by a mother. Within weeks, friends of friends (and even their families) knew not only my name, but also what food I liked, what I cooked, and what I absolutely couldn’t resist.\nHere are some of the tastes that make me long for next summer:\n\nWatermelon cocktail\nPerfect for an aperitivo or BBQ. This never fails to win over friends, and is ideal in hot weather.\nCut a watermelon in half, scoop out the fruit, and mix it with strawberries, peaches, kiwi, grapes, sugar syrup, and vodka. Let it rest in the fridge for at least three hours (overnight is even better). Serve chilled in cups or directly from the watermelon shell.\n\n\nSummer salad\nGreat when the last thing you want is to cook. Slice ripe tomatoes, add cubes of Greek cheese, drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and chill briefly. Fresh, quick, and satisfying.\nBack in Colombia, food often felt like an obligation. I ate so I’d have the energy to study, but eating a meal never felt fulfilling. I was constantly in need of snacks between meals — chocolate, chips, anything quick. Cooking itself felt more burdensome than comforting. But in Italy, it’s different; here food means fried seafood with lemon, a community table where someone will serve me something that is both delicious and lovingly prepared when I am feeling too blase to cook for myself. And that has taught me to see food differently. I no longer eat to get by; I eat because food delights my senses. To eat because you love is different. Eating out of love is the life I want."

    "text": "If you’re a 2000s baby, you probably grew up with films like “The Lizzie McGuire Movie” or “Call Me by Your Name.” Summer flings, Vespa rides, and sunburns are often the first things that come to mind when we imagine Italy in July or August. But that’s not the whole picture for Gen Z Italians.\nFor many young Italians, these months are very intense. Some are preparing for the university entrance exams. Others are splitting their days between quick beach trips and long hours at the library. And the luckiest ones? They’re celebrating the end of this chapter with a full-blown festa di laurea.\nGraduation day is one of the most anticipated moments for any university student, anywhere in the world. Unlike the stressful summer exam season, this is a time of joy and release.\nItalian universities don’t typically host a big ceremony with caps and gowns. The event is intimate and personal. And to keep things exciting, on the same day there’s still one final hurdle: defending your thesis in front of friends, family, and a panel of professors, who announce your final grade on the spot. Only then are you officially laureato (you hold a degree).\nThese spontaneous celebrations can last for hours, or until everyone loses their voice. It’s loud, it’s proud, it’s jocular (goliardate). And impossible to ignore. It shouldn’t be any other way.\nThe word laurea, meaning graduation, comes from laurel, and tradition dictates that the new graduate wears a laurel crown as a symbol of wisdom and achievement. These are often handmade by family or friends and customized with ribbons or charms in the graduate’s faculty colors.\nThen begins the fun part: goliardic songs and the shout of “Dottore! Dottore!” echoing through the streets, bars, university halls, and restaurants. These spontaneous celebrations can last for hours, or until everyone loses their voice. It’s loud, it’s proud, it’s jocular (goliardate). And impossible to ignore. It shouldn’t be any other way. Graduation is a big deal!\nA great cure for a sore throat? A good Spritz and probably a few more drinks after that. Next comes the family meal, where close friends often tag along. Don’t expect to leave anytime soon: there will be a first course, second course, dessert, espresso, and more aperitifs, sometimes stretching into the evening. If you’re lucky enough to be invited, come hungry and clear your calendar.\nIn cities like Padova, Trieste, or Bologna, family meals are often followed by a graduation party organized by friends.\nThese parties often include children’s games, playful punishments, and creative challenges. Some are held at home, while the bolder students opt for public spaces where the embarrassment is worse and the fun better. What one must have, especially for a Bachelor’s degree, is the papiro (a handmade, human-sized poster featuring a caricature of the graduate, filled with gossip, jokes, and a rhyming poem that must be read aloud). The reading is non-negotiable, but you can rely on the wine handed to you to ease the nerves.\nThere’s no official guide on how to survive an Italian graduation party, but one thing’s certain: From ridiculous costumes to wild dares involving strangers, anything can happen. The only rules are to record it all and have as much fun as possible.\nGraduation is always a reason to show love and support. If it happens in summer, there’s double the cause for celebration. Just remember to choose your outfit wisely, because you don’t want to be sweating in every photo."

    "text": "When I first applied for my residence permit in Italy, I signed an agreement stating that I would commit to becoming well-integrated into Italian life within two years. But I had no clue what “well-integrated” was supposed to mean. Not a single person at the questura (or local police headquarters) explained anything about it. In fact, it was only months later that I found out that I had made this promise to become well-integrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEditor’s Note: For the purposes of this essay, this issue of assimilation should be considered distinct from any Italian citizenship concerns through the jus sanguinis, or descendent blood line law, which has had some changes of late, as well as aside from the hot-button issue of refugees, political asylum, or labor-trafficking embedded in Law No. 187/2024.\n\n\nAfter a quick Google search, I found out about the percorso d’integrazione obbligatorio, a mandatory path or credit system that applies to every non-Italian above the age of sixteen who arrives in the country for the first time. It’s almost like a video game: you start with sixteen points, and the goal is to acquire at least thirty points by completing specific tasks. If you don’t meet the requirements within a certain timeframe, you lose points. Fair enough, I thought.\nThe list includes things like taking language or cultural classes, earning a degree, or buying a house. Although the first two sound very reasonable, I began to wonder how achievable all of this is for most people. I’m a Spanish speaker, I have an Italian partner, and I already hold a degree, all of which gives me a theoretical advantage over other immigrants who might be struggling to understand where to start. Bureaucracy is often slow and confusing. Perhaps that’s the real game.\nNobody ever said that immigrating was easy. It’s a process, and it takes time — more for some, less for others. Immigrant, for me and the dictionary, means coming to live permanently in a country in which you were not born. Your genes, race, story, motivations, and future plans don’t count once you land. All immigrants become people who hope to feel at home again.\nHome is where you can relax and be yourself. Your safe place. It doesn’t have to be a place, really. It can be a feeling you carry with you.\nWhile having all these thoughts, I found myself wondering again: What does it mean to be well-integrated? Is it just speaking the language fluently and hiding your accent? Is it being able to cook Italian food like a local and eat it every single day? Or maybe becoming a regular at the neighborhood bar and ordering your drink in dialect? Is it about becoming Italian in the legal sense?\nI thought of a friend. She’s 26, almost 27, and has lived here for 20 years, attending school her entire life in Italy. She pays taxes and owns a home. She speaks Italian — and the Triestine dialect — without a hint of an accent. She also runs a business, which creates a lot of jobs for many people. And yet, legally, she’s not Italian.\nDoes she feel well-integrated? It’s hard to say. Too Colombian for Italy, too Italian for Colombia. Something’s missing.\nTo be well-integrated, do you have to give up your identity completely?\nIn early 2025, I had the chance to participate in the Latitudes project with other immigrants from Latin-America living in Europe. On Monday, we arrived as strangers. One week later, we left as a family, bound by a connection that felt completely natural. Maybe it was the food, the dancing, the shared language, the jokes, or the joy of reliving similar experiences.\nBeing born as a person from Latin America means growing up with the same kind of mom, the same neighborhood adventures, the same strict schoolteachers, the same quinceañera parties, the same unforgettable house parties full of dancing and gossip. We discovered that it’s impossible to forget who you were before arriving in Italy. We are immigrants, and our identity migrates with us. We are Latinos in Europe, but Latin America lives inside each of us.\nI don’t really know when you get to feel “well-integrated,” but I’m sure you’ll recognize it by the laughter and the warmth of the hugs you’ll receive in your new home."
