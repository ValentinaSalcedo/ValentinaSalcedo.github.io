Italy is renowned for its coffee shops on every corner. This devotion to coffee, however, is taken to a whole different level in Trieste. Trieste was one of the first European cities to open the *botteghe da caffè*. In the 1700s, these coffeehouses became popular as meeting places for politicians, artists, journalists, writers, and intellectuals. The city’s strategic location between what was once the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Slovenia meant that it was a key entry point for the high-quality green coffee beans coming from Asia, South America, and Africa. Trieste is also the birthplace of the renowned Illy company, a pioneer in espresso machine innovation.

In all this time, not much has changed in terms of coffee. Trieste’s inhabitants are very proud of the history and culture that have taken place in their cafés. Like many Italians, they love their coffee. And to make sure that everyone is aware just how important coffee is to them, they’ve made coffee drinking their thing.

If you want to order like a true Triestino, you will need a dictionary first. Here’s a quick guide, in case you don’t have one.

-   **Nero:** A standard espresso served in a small cup.

-   **Capo:** A version of a cappuccino with just a touch of milk, similar to an espresso macchiato.

-   **Gocciato**: An espresso with a small drop of milk foam on top.

These are just a few of the dozens of combinations you can order. To really impress your Italian server, ask for the capo in b (same as capo but in a glass). They will be surprised to see that a tourist unaccompanied by a local seems to know about this classic coffee.

But where can you savor this experience?
