If you’re a 2000s baby, you probably grew up with films like “The Lizzie McGuire Movie” or “Call Me by Your Name.” Summer flings, Vespa rides, and sunburns are often the first things that come to mind when we imagine Italy in July or August. But that’s not the whole picture for Gen Z Italians.

For many young Italians, these months are very intense. Some are preparing for the university entrance exams. Others are splitting their days between quick beach trips and long hours at the library. And the luckiest ones? They’re celebrating the end of this chapter with a full-blown *festa di laurea*.

Graduation day is one of the most anticipated moments for any university student, anywhere in the world. Unlike the stressful summer exam season, this is a time of joy and release.

Italian universities don’t typically host a big ceremony with caps and gowns. The event is intimate and personal. And to keep things exciting, on the same day there’s still one final hurdle: defending your thesis in front of friends, family, and a panel of professors, who announce your final grade on the spot. Only then are you officially *laureato* (you hold a degree).


These spontaneous celebrations can last for hours, or until everyone loses their voice. It’s loud, it’s proud, it’s jocular (*goliardate*). And impossible to ignore. It shouldn’t be any other way.

The word *laurea*, meaning graduation, comes from laurel, and tradition dictates that the new graduate wears a laurel crown as a symbol of wisdom and achievement. These are often handmade by family or friends and customized with ribbons or charms in the graduate’s faculty colors.

Then begins the fun part: goliardic songs and the shout of “*Dottore! Dottore!*” echoing through the streets, bars, university halls, and restaurants. These spontaneous celebrations can last for hours, or until everyone loses their voice. It’s loud, it’s proud, it’s jocular (*goliardate*). And impossible to ignore. It shouldn’t be any other way. Graduation is a big deal!

A great cure for a sore throat? A good Spritz and probably a few more drinks after that. Next comes the family meal, where close friends often tag along. Don’t expect to leave anytime soon: there will be a first course, second course, dessert, espresso, and more aperitifs, sometimes stretching into the evening. If you’re lucky enough to be invited, come hungry and clear your calendar.

In cities like Padova, Trieste, or Bologna, family meals are often followed by a graduation party organized by friends.

These parties often include children’s games, playful punishments, and creative challenges. Some are held at home, while the bolder students opt for public spaces where the embarrassment is worse and the fun better. What one must have, especially for a Bachelor’s degree, is the *papiro* (a handmade, human-sized poster featuring a caricature of the graduate, filled with gossip, jokes, and a rhyming poem that *must* be read aloud). The reading is non-negotiable, but you can rely on the wine handed to you to ease the nerves.

There’s no official guide on how to survive an Italian graduation party, but one thing’s certain: From ridiculous costumes to wild dares involving strangers, anything can happen. The only rules are to record it all and have as much fun as possible.

Graduation is always a reason to show love and support. If it happens in summer, there’s double the cause for celebration. Just remember to choose your outfit wisely, because you don’t want to be sweating in every photo.
